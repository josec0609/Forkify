# Forkify

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with forkify-api API to fetch and display food recipes. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6+ code back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and add ingredients to a shopping list or save said recipe to their favorites list via local storage.
